# LoL-Win-Prediction
### A ML model that predicts league of legends game outcomes based on champion selection

## Introduction
League of Legends, often abbreviated as LoL, is a popular online multiplayer video game. It's a competitive 5 versus 5 team-based game in which players control unique champions with special abilities and work together to defeat the opposing team. The main objective is to destroy the enemy team's Nexus, a structure in their base, while defending your own. It combines elements of strategy, teamwork, and individual skill and is known for its strategic depth and fast-paced action. League of Legends is played by millions of players worldwide and has a thriving esports scene with professional leagues and tournaments.

In the competitive environment of League of Legends, players are always looking for ways to improve their chances of winning. Since it's a strategy game, one key element affecting a team's success is the mix of champions they pick. Our aim is to create a model that helps players make better decisions about champion selection and team composition by predicting the likelihood of each team winning based on their chosen champions. This also enables the most dedicated players to dodge an unfavorable matchup before the game begins in such a case where the prediction of their chances of winning are looking less than good.

The information about the match is limited to just the champions picked before the game actually begins, so we are going to be using only this information for training our model.

    "## Introduction\n",
    "League of Legends, often abbreviated as LoL, is a popular online multiplayer video game. It's a competitive 5 versus 5 team-based game in which players control unique champions with special abilities and work together to defeat the opposing team. The main objective is to destroy the enemy team's Nexus, a structure in their base, while defending your own. It combines elements of strategy, teamwork, and individual skill and is known for its strategic depth and fast-paced action. League of Legends is played by millions of players worldwide and has a thriving esports scene with professional leagues and tournaments.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the competitive environment of League of Legends, players are always looking for ways to improve their chances of winning. Since it's a strategy game, one key element affecting a team's success is the mix of champions they pick. Our aim is to create a model that helps players make better decisions about champion selection and team composition by predicting the likelihood of each team winning based on their chosen champions. This also enables the most dedicated players to dodge an unfavorable matchup before the game begins in such a case where the prediction of their chances of winning are looking less than good.\n",
    "\n",
    "The information about the match is limited to just the champions picked before the game actually begins, so we are going to be using only this information for training our model. \n",

    "## Dataset\n",
    "There are several datasets available online that contain information about the outcome of the game, champions selected, player stats and much more. There is also the official Riot Games API available, which could be used to gather data from the latest version of the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purpose of this concept, we will be using a dataset from Kaggle. This gives us easy access to a lot of training data, without being limited by the API. While this means that the data is not up to date, it is still a good starting point for our model and useful for evaluating the concept.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset [League of Legends- 1 day's worth of solo queue KR](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/junhachoi/all-ranked-solo-games-on-kr-server-24-hours/) contains information about all ranked matches on the League of Legends Korean Server during the course of 1 day (GMT 2022/07/02 00:00:00 to 2022/07/03 00:00:00). In total, this amounts to over 250.000 matches. The advantage this dataset has over other datasets is that it is very large and one of the most recent ones available. The data is also from a single day, which means that the game version is the same for all matches. This is important because the game is constantly being updated and the balance of champions changes with every patch. This means that the data from older patches is not as useful for training our model.\n"
